# PDF_watermark
Run this script in the console, it merges the first pdf to the rest of the pdfs.


This is a simply watermark script for PDFs.

I run this in my console, the first parameter after the script is the "watermark" pdf and all remaining pdf parameters will have that watermark merged onto their pages.

for example 
>> python3 watermark.py watermark.pdf book1.pdf book2.pdf flyer1.pdf
